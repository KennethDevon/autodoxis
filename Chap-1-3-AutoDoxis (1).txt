CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
 1.1  Rationale of the Study
      Nowadays, in the digital environment, organizations face significant challenges in managing large volumes of documents, particularly when it comes to routing these documents to the correct departments or personnel. Traditional methods of handling document routing are often manual, resulting in human error, inefficiencies, and delays in processing critical documents. As organizations scale and data volumes increase, these manual processes become increasingly impractical, hindering overall organizational productivity. This study presents an Automated Document Routing System powered by descriptive analytics to address these challenges. The core approach used in the system involves descriptive analytics methods, which are known for their robustness and ability to summarize and interpret historical data. This approach reduces inefficiencies, improves decision-making accuracy, and enables the system to adapt to both structured and unstructured data, ensuring that documents are categorized and routed based on their context.
    By integrating descriptive analytics into the routing process, the system utilizes historical routing data to identify document categories, determine the most appropriate routes, and adjust workflows based on observed trends. The system handles physical documents manually until they arrive at their designated office, where a digital record is created to track the document’s progress. This record allows for real-time tracking of documents as they move through various stages of the workflow. The system's adaptive workflow functionality optimizes routing based on patterns found in past data and operational needs, ensuring that documents are processed efficiently and promptly. With descriptive analytics at its core, the system remains capable of scaling to meet the increasing volume and complexity of documents. Research by Egger (2022) underscores the growing importance of analytics in optimizing operations across industries.
    One of the most pressing issues in organizational workflows is the delay of documents within certain departments or offices, which causes bottlenecks, slows decision-making, and reduces operational efficiency. This study addresses these delays by incorporating real-time document tracking features. The system enables document owners and administrators to trace the precise location of each document within the workflow at any given time. By capturing timestamps as documents enter and exit different stages, the system determines how long a document spends in each phase, making it easier to identify where delays occur. Additionally, the system generates detailed delay reports, highlighting departments or offices with prolonged processing times. These reports empower management to pinpoint inefficiencies and take targeted actions to optimize workflow. By combining descriptive analytics-driven routing with real-time tracking and reporting, the system ensures transparency and accountability throughout the document’s life cycle, ultimately leading to smoother operations, fewer delays, and higher productivity.
 1.2  Purpose and Project Description
        This study aims to develop Automated Document Routing For Adaptive Workflow Optimization System with Descriptive Analytics, which is designed to classify and route documents based on patterns observed in historical record. The system supports the processing of PDF files, Word documents (DOCX), scanned images (JPG/PNG), text files (TXT), and manually uploaded email attachments. Each uploaded document is tagged with metadata such as document type, sender name, submission time, and priority level. The descriptive analytics approach uses this metadata—along with historical routing data and user feedback—to determine the most appropriate office or personnel to receive the document.
    Once classified, the document is routed through the system where it is tracked in real time, with timestamps logged at every stage. If a document exceeds its expected processing time in any office, the system triggers a delay alert to the document owner and the responsible department. AutoDoxis also features a dashboard that visualizes document flow, routing accuracy, and delay reports, enabling administrators to identify bottlenecks. Through the integration of descriptive analytics-based routing and delay analysis, the system minimizes human error, reduces workflow inefficiencies, and supports continual improvement based on data insights.
1.3 Objectives of the Study
     The main objective of the project is to develop an Automated Document Routing For Adaptive Workflow Optimization System with Descriptive Analytics for adaptive workflow optimization to enhance efficiency, reduce delays, improve communication, and provide real-time updates while offering an intuitive user interface and performance monitoring tools.

1.6 Conceptual Framework

    The conceptual framework for the system is structured using the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model, which illustrates the step-by-step flow of document management and routing. 
    To begin with, the Input stage gathers essential data required for document classification and routing. This includes uploaded documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, JPG, PNG, and TXT), along with metadata such as sender name, timestamp, document type, and priority level. Additional inputs include user feedback for correcting or confirming routing decisions, document and office information, and user-specific details such as roles and permissions. These data elements provide the necessary context for the system to make informed and accurate routing decisions. 
    In the Process stage, the system performs real-time document tracking and monitoring. As documents move through different stages, the system logs timestamps and builds audit trails. A core component of this phase is the application of descriptive analytics methods, which analyze historical data and current metadata to determine the most appropriate route. The system also performs delay detection, automatically generating alerts when documents remain too long in a specific office. Real-time notifications are sent to users, ensuring timely updates and transparency. 
    As a result, the Output stage delivers the key functionalities that support organizational workflow optimization. These include the successful and timely forwarding of documents, clear visibility of document status, and generation of performance analytics and delay reports.

2.2  Related Literature
    According to Al-Amin et al. (2024), they proposed an AI-based end-to-end workflow optimization solution specifically for SMEs. The paper underlines the role of AI technologies, especially RPA, predictive analytics, and data integration, in overcoming typical SME problems like fragmented information, manual procedures, and scalability constraints. The authors' framework presents a multi-tiered structure that includes a data integration layer, predictive analytics through descriptive analytics techniques, and intelligent automation tools. A phased implementation strategy has been crafted for SMEs with real-time decision-making, customer experience enhancement, and operational resilience highlighted as key outcomes.
    A hybrid system is proposed by Amin et al. (2018), wherein deep learning is combined with case-based reasoning (CBR) for dynamic workflow routing in customer support. The name of their system is DeepTMS, which utilizes deep neural networks to process unstructured and multilingual text, thereby allowing real-time prioritization and routing of customer tickets. This method overcomes the drawbacks faced by conventional NLP tools, especially in complicated and diverse customer service situations. The system automates text analysis by embedding semantic-aware word embedding together with neural similarity measures, adapts to changing workflows, and incrementally constructs a reusable case base. That would be most beneficial in high-volume industries where both case similarity and resolution speed are important factors.
    Debbadi and Boateng (2025) introduced intelligent automation within Microsoft Power Automate by contextualizing advanced analytics algorithms for dynamic real-time workflow adaptation. The cloud-based service solution supports tasks such as anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, sentiment analysis, and intelligent document processing. The study reinforces adaptive workflows that self-optimize through continuous learning from historical as well as real-time data. Power Automate also holds great potential as a low-code platform. Of the several critical challenges surfaced—model deployment, latency at inference, and complexity of integration—the enhancements in process efficiency along with decision accuracy related to these hurdles have been discovered to be quite impactful.
